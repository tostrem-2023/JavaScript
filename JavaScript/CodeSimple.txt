Write a program that displays the message "Welcome to CodeSimple!" on the screen.
PRINT "Welcome to CodeSimple!"

Write a program that calculates the difference between two numbers (e.g. 15 and 7) and displays the result on the screen.
SET num1 = 15
SET num2 = 7
SET difference = SUBTRACT num1 - num2
PRINT difference

Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and displays the larger of the two numbers.
INPUT "Enter the first number" num1 => 5
INPUT "Enter the second number" num2 => 10
IF num1 > num2 THEN
    PRINT num1
ELSE
    PRINT num2

Write a program that uses a loop to display the even numbers from 2 to 20 on the screen.
2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20
SET num=2
LOOP 10 TIMES
    PRINT num
    SET num = ADD num + 2

Write a program that calculates the square of a number provided by the user and displays the result.
INPUT "Enter a number" num
SET square = MULTIPLY num * num
PRINT square

Write a program that generates the Fibonacci (sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers) sequence up to the 10th term and displays it.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
    0 |   1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34
term1   term2  -->   -->   -->   ->
SET term1 = 0
SET term2 = 1
PRINT term1
LOOP 9 TIMES
    PRINT term2
    SET nextTerm = ADD term1 + term2
    SET term1 = term2
    SET term2 = nextTerm

Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number and displays the result. 
*(Factorial = the product of a whole number with every whole number below it.)
    Ex: 5=5(4)(3)(2)(1)=120
INPUT "Enter a number" num => 5
SET factorial = 1 (because it's always in the factorial)
LOOP num TIMES
    SET factorial = MULTIPLY factorial * num
    SET num = SUBTRACT num - 1

Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and display the result.
SET sum = 0
SET count = 1
LOOP 100 TIMES
    SET sum = ADD sum + count
    SET count = ADD count + 1

Write a program that calculates the average of three numbers provided by the user and display the result.
INPUT "Enter the first number" num1 => 1
INPUT "Enter the second number" num2 => 2
INPUT "Enter the third number" num3 => 3
SET sum = ADD num1 + num2 + num3
SET average = DIVIDE sum / 3
PRINT "The average is" + average

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and then displays all the even numbers up to that integer.
INPUT "Enter a positive integer" num
SET count = 2
LOOP num / 2 TIMES
    PRINT count
    SET count = count + 2
